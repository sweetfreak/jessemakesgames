          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hailing from the exotic suburbs of Connecticut, I now reside within a <strike>rent-stabilized apartment</strike> <i>luxurious bungalow</i> in Brooklyn, NY. After studying screenwriting and TV production at Emerson College, I began my career in Los Angeles voiceover and animation studios before returning to the east coast. There, I joined Nickelodeon's game department and throughout my tenure there, directed 18 games for their (now defunct) Noggin app.

          <br></br>
          While off the clock, I spent my free time focusing on learning to code and understand game development. I completed a full-stack web development bootcamp via Columbia University, learned iOS app development, and created a handful of games using Unity and Godot. I've fallen in love with game design and enjoy creating games as a form of social commentary – but I've also been known to make pixel art games about white collar frogs or surfing flamingos.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I've been looking for full-time work since Noggin closed its doors in 2024, but that doesn't mean I haven't been busy. Over the past year, I've become a Certified ScrumMaster, freelanced as a QA Tester for the game "Entropy Survivors", and recently completed a video game writing intensive via Gotham Writers Workshop. Additionally, I've participated in several game jams, released a couple games, and began designing a game for a smaller indie LLC.
